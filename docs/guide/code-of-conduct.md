# Code of Conduct

Trotsky is a modular framework designed to facilitate structured interactions with ATProto/Bluesky APIs.

By integrating the following principles, Trotsky pushes developers to build applications that are robust, user-friendly, and respectful of the broader digital ecosystem. This approach not only enhances the functionality of individual applications but also contributes to the sustainability and reliability of the services they utilize.

1. **Understand and Follow API Terms**: Before integrating with any API, thoroughly review and comply with its terms of service, usage policies, and documentation. This ensures lawful and ethical use of the API.

2. **Respect Rate Limits**: Bluesky's APIs enforce [rate limits](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits) to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Implement appropriate mechanisms in your application to monitor and adhere to these limits, avoiding excessive requests that could lead to service disruption or account suspension.

3. **Disclosure of Automated Agents**: If your application includes automated agents or bots, clearly identify them as such. Transparency helps maintain trust within the community and complies with platform policies.

4. **Avoid Unsolicited Interactions**: Design bots to refrain from initiating unsolicited interactions with users. Ensure that automated engagements are contextually appropriate and welcomed by the recipients to prevent perceptions of spam or harassment.

5. **Protect User Data**: Handle all user data with the utmost care. Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks.

6. **Comply with Data Protection Regulations**: Ensure that your application's data handling practices comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, to safeguard user privacy rights.

7. **Optimize API Calls**: Design your application to make efficient use of API calls. Implement caching strategies where appropriate and avoid redundant requests to reduce load on the API servers and improve application performance.

8. **Avoid Malicious Activities**: Do not use APIs to engage in activities that are harmful, unethical, or illegal, such as spreading misinformation, or conducting unauthorized surveillance.

9. **Promote Positive Interactions**: Use APIs to build applications that contribute positively to the community, fostering engagement, accessibility, and value for users.
