/**
 * This package provides a comprehensive suite of TypeScript classes and utilities designed 
 * to facilitate interaction with the AT Protocol (ATProto) and Bluesky's social networking 
 * services. 
 * 
 * It offers a structured approach to building and executing sequences of 
 * operations—referred to as "steps"—that interact with various aspects of the protocol, 
 * such as managing user profiles, posts, likes, follows, and more. 
 * 
 * By leveraging the schema 
 * definitions outlined in the AT Proto lexicons,  this package ensures type safety and 
 * consistency when interfacing with ATProto's decentralized social networking ecosystem.
